Here's the order of steps that I would implement:

1. Get 10 or so small divs on the screen

2. Add an event listener to each so that when I click on a pixel it turns red

3. Add a color palette div with 2 colors(red and purple)which allows the user to set the current "paintbrush" color instead of it always being set to red

4. Add the rest of the standard rainbow colors to the color palette

5. Add enough divs to fill up the entire screen
